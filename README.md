A personal practise use XPBD.

Use FloodFill to create Delaunay Tetra,with ComputeShader accelerate the building.

XPBD part is only a basic implementation, there are still some parts that need improvement.

Video of the project is in https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1C2GqzfEoi/

The main development idea for this project comes from Matthias Müller,reference in https://www.youtube.com/c/TenMinutePhysics

My main work is porting it to Unity and using ComputeShader to accelerate speed in GPU.
